# Paradox-Ethernet-USB-Interface
Paradox Ethernet - USB Interface , Transfers Serial On board port to Ethernet Telnet Session or USB connection
Paradox Alarm Panels (SP and EVO series) uses on board Serial port for Interfacing IP Modules(IP150) , USB converters for Local Programming or other staff.
This device forwards Alarm serial data to a Ethernet/IP/Telnet Session. Furthermore integrates a USB to Serial Adapter. 
In other Words 307USB and IP150 combined in a single low cost design based on Arduino Mega 2560. 


# Paradox-Ethernet-USB-Interface

* USB Connection to Panel (usb to serial implemented on Paradox Interface) similar function to 307USB.Requires 120-Ohm Resistor between Reset and 5V.
* DHCP functionality and OLED display to inform IP address and Serial Settings.
* Static IP addressing is recommended.
* Up to 3 multiple Connection.
* Telnet to Port 23 to show device CLI.
* Settings stored to internal EEPROM.
* Serial Baud rate is configurable to support SP and EVO series Panels.
* OLED Display for convenient use , as informs for device IP address and Serial Port Settings.
* DC-DC down converter is optional but recommended to avoid over heating Arduino Board regulator.
* 3D-Print case has been designed to accommodate device.
